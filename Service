Troubleshooting Steps :
Verify that you are accessing the service's cluster IP from within the cluster.
Make sure your readiness probe is working.
Using kubectl get endpoints, you can check Endpoints object to see if a pod is a member of the service.
Verify that you are connecting to the service's exposed port and not the target port.
To make sure your pod is allowing connections on the right port, try connecting directly to the pod IP.
