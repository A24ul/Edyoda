Troubleshooting Steps :
Verify that you are accessing the service's cluster IP from within the cluster and not from the outside.
Make sure your readiness probe is working if you defined one; otherwise, the pod won't be included in the service.
Using kubectl get endpoints, you can check the corresponding Endpoints object to see if a pod is a member of the service.
Verify that you are connecting to the service's exposed port and not the target port.
To make sure your pod is allowing connections on the right port, try connecting directly to the pod IP.
